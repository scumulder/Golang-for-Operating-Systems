# Golang-for-Operating-Systems

Learning Objective: To gain a fuller understanding of disk seek algorithms by implementing them.

Development: Implemented in GO. 

Assignment: Implement the first-come first-served scheduling, shortest seek time first, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, CLOOK algorithms. Calculate and output the total amount of movements for the input cylinder requests and starting position.

Input: The program reads a file specified in the first command line parameter. These files are the .txt files provided in this repository. It then outputs the request and servicing order of the disks.
